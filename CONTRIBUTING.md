# Welcome to fastnd

I'm happy that you would like to contribute, and we welcome you with open arms. However we request you to follow some rules:

1. Run `cargo fmt` before you commit
1. All your changes must be done on a separate branch
1. Your function must have at least one test in [tests.rs](src/tests.rs)
